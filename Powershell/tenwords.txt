PowerShell
providers
are
programs
based
on
NET
Framework
which
make
the
data
in
a
specialized
storage
available
for
viewing
and
management
The
data
provided
by
the
provider
appears
as
a
disk
and
access
to
the
data
occurs
along
the
path
as
if
the
work
was
done
with
a
hard
disk
in
the
file
system
You
can
create
or
write
your
own
provider
or
use
third
party
providers
To
view
the
available
providers
in
the
current
console
session
you
can
use
the
Get
PSProvider
comadlet
Providers
are
installed
via
PowerShell
modules:
importing
a
module
using
the
Import
Module
comadlet
loads
and
installs
providers
It
follows
from
this
that
the
provider
is
deleted
by
deleting
the
module
using
the
Remove
Module
comadlet
but
the
built
in
providers
cannot
be
deleted
from
the
console
session
You
can
also
use
the
Remove
PSDrive
comadlet
which
removes
the
disk
from
the
current
console
session
The
data
in
the
disk
will
not
be
affected
but
the
disk
will
no
longer
be
available
